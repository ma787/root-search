1.	Ask for the degree and the coefficients of the polynomial.
2.	Ask for an interval to search for the roots.
3.	Check if the sign changes in the interval. If it does, go to step 7.
4.	If it doesnâ€™t, inform the user that there are no roots/even number of roots in the interval.
5.	Ask the user if they want to try again with a different interval. If they do, go to step 2.
6.	Stop.
7.	Find the midpoint of the interval.
8.	Find the value of the function at the bounds and the midpoint.
9.	If the value of the function is smaller the degree of accuracy, return the midpoint as the root.
10.	Stop.
11.	If the value is the same sign as value at the upper bound, set the midpoint as the upper bound and go to step 7.
12.	If the value is the same sign as the value at the lower bound, set the midpoint as the lower bound and go to step 7.
